# blogging-api

This project was about creating back-end API routes for a web application. I was given a completed project which accessed a given API endpoints. My job was to create all the Java servlets, DAO, and Java Beans and write the SQL script to create a database to move the data from the existing API to a new database. Then to use the servlets, DAO and javabeans to retrieve articles/comments from the database and display them on the web page. This invovled re-writting the JavaScript fetch, and script to perform better.
